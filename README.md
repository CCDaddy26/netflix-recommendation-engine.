# 🎬 Netflix Recommendation Engine — Machine Learning Capstone Project (Python)

**Status**: ✅ Completed | **Platform**: Google Colab | **Domain**: Data Science & ML

As part of my continuous journey in machine learning and real-world problem solving, I recently completed a capstone project focused on building a **Netflix-style Recommendation Engine** using Python.

The objective was to simulate how leading OTT platforms like Netflix personalize user experiences through advanced recommendation systems. Leveraging collaborative filtering and data-driven insights, I developed a model that recommends the most relevant movies to users based on their historical ratings and genre preferences.
